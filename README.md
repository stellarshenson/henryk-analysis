# Henryk Analysis
This project intends to analyse the data related to my son, Henry.
Henry is currently alienated fro me, his father. I can only hope that
statistical analysis of the data available to me would reveal patterns
of his mother behaviour that I can submit to the court as evidence

## Components
The following components of the analysis were developed

- **recordings** - analysis of my recordings for Henry, that is their duration, frequency and other stats
- **visits** - analysis of my meetings with Henry. Mainly the analysis of the probabilities of certain events such as Henry's sickness that conicidentally happend during my visits and other things
