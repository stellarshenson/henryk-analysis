# Henryk Analysis
Primary purpose for this project is to build a plaform that will allow my recordings
to reach my son over many channels - and one day he would see how much legacy and love
is waiting for him. 

This project serves also a therapeutic role for me - while waiting
for the court system to find their own backside, I have to deal with the ever-agressive
patterns of Parental Alienation. But his is nothing. I can deal with it. I have a therapist
and a circle of friends who support me no matter what. But my son has only his mother.
And it is his mother that is taking away from him the love, support and closenes of a loving parent.
I cannot imagine what he must be going through. He is only 3y old, but the separation and
ever present hatred combined with almost obsessive fear - must have taken a toll on this young one.

My heart bleeds at the slightes mention or thought of this. And then ... I sit and build.
Build my life. Build my career. Build great technologies. For the hope that one day I 
will be able to share this with him. And maybe, just maybe, I will see him smile some day.

This project focuses on over 500+ recordings that I have prepared for my son - and continue to do so.
In those recordings I am telling him the stories. Stories of my life, his family here, his peers who
have never had a chance to meet him. And places he has never been able to visit - places so wonderful, that
my heard cheers on the sligtes thought that we may yet share those moments sometime in the future.

Those recordings are processed, information is extracted and will be delivered to different channels - that being
text, that being videos and stories, that may one day reach my sone despite the ever present dome of fear and hatred.

As a side effect of the work I do on the AI and automation - I was able to build powerful statistical reasoning
framework for my court case - and a pile of evidence that no one will be able to question. Making this project
public allows me to claim transparency and share with everyone the tools, methods, methodology and the craft that
I did use to make this everything happen.

I can only hope that
statistical analysis of the data available to me would reveal patterns
of his mother behaviour that I can submit to the court as evidence

## Components
As of now following components of the analysis were developed

- **recordings** - analysis of my recordings for Henry, that is their duration, frequency and other stats. Now it also has automated transcription and automated classification through NLP reasoning over some well crafter prompts - that anyone can run on the same data that I have had available. And achieve similar results. 
- **visits** - analysis of my meetings with Henry. Mainly the analysis of the probabilities of certain events such as Henry's sickness that conicidentally happend during my visits and other things

**IMPORTANT**

Recordings and transcriptions are not publically available yet. They are encrypted and my lawyers are looking into them (yesss, all 500+ of them) and will tell me if I can release them to the public. Once I do this - chances that one of those humble recordings gets finally to my son ... I can't even think of it. Videos will follow. But those videos will be based on the recordings thanks to a technogy that is cooking on my RTX 4090 GPU as we speak. Hush. 

Feel free to play with the datasets available in the `data/processed`, specifically the classification datasets. Super interesting. You will like it.
